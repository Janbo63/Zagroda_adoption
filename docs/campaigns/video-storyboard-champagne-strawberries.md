## 🛠️ Production Notes for Influencer/Team
- **Lighting:** Golden hour is essential. The contrast of the orange sun on white snow creates the "premium" feel.
- **Color Grading:** Warm the shadows, keep the whites of the snow crisp but not blue.
- **Interaction:** The "strawberries" are for the humans, but ensure the alpacas are close enough to create that "shared moment" vibe.
- **Equipment:** iPhone (4K 60fps) or Mirrorless for high quality. Use ND filters for the snow glare.
