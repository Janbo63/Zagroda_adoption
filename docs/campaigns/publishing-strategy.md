# Publishing Strategy: Valentine's "Winter vol Liefde"

This guide explains the workflow for publishing the campaign materials to maximize engagement and ensure technical stability.

## 📅 The Publishing Workflow

### 1. Manual Posting (Instagram & Facebook)
Since we want high engagement, manual posting is recommended for Instagram & Facebook to use platform-specific features like Link Stickers and Polls.

**Steps for each post**:
1.  **Visuals**: Download the image/video from the `docs/campaigns/assets` (or use the mockups provided).
2.  **Caption**: Open [social-media-templates.md](file:///f:/New%20Alpaca%20Site/ZAPnew2/docs/campaigns/social-media-templates.md) and copy the caption for the specific day.
3.  **Location**: Always tag "Zagroda Alpakoterapii, Poland".
4.  **Stories**: Immediately after posting to the feed, share the post to your Story with:
    -   A **Link Sticker** pointing to: `https://zagrodaalpakoterapii.com/nl/winter-vol-liefde`
    -   An **Engagement Sticker** (Poll or Slider).

### 2. Ad Management (Meta Ads Manager)
We have allocated a budget for boosting posts.
- **Goal**: "Traffic" (to the landing page) or "Engagement".
- **Targeting**: Interests like *Winter vol Liefde*, *Alpaca*, *Wellness*, *Travel Poland*, and *Gift Ideas*.
- **Timeline**: Boost each day's main post for 24-48 hours.

### 3. Automated Monitoring
I have integrated tracking into the checkout flow. As visitors come from social media, we will see:
-   **Source**: Which platform they came from.
-   **Campaign**: Verification that they are part of the Valentine's sprint.

## 🛠️ Tools to Use
- **Meta Business Suite**: Schedule posts across FB and IG simultaneously to save time.
- **Canva (Optional)**: Use our mockups as a base to add your farm logo or specific pricing text.
- **Stripe Dashboard**: Monitor voucher sales in real-time to see which posts are converting best.

## 🚨 Emergency Protocol
If the site goes down or a link breaks:
1.  Pause all active Ad Spend immediately.
2.  Notify me (Antigravity) to fix the server issue (like we did with the translation key).
3.  Update the "Link in Bio" to a temporary landing page or direct contact if needed.
