# Customer Journey: The Valentine's Alpaca Experience

This document maps the journey of a potential customer from discovering the campaign on social media to completing a purchase.

---

## 🎨 Phase 1: The "Scroll-Stop" (TikTok/Instagram/FB)

**The Hook**: The user is scrolling their feed and sees a high-quality, professional photo of an alpaca (Elvis) with the text: **"Elvis doesn't judge your Red Flags 🚩"**.

**The Psychology**:
- **Relevance**: It taps into the current "Winter vol Liefde" TV trend.
- **Humor**: It contrasts heavy relationship drama with the innocent face of an alpaca.
- **Attention**: The text is unexpected and bold.

**Action**: The user stops scrolling and taps into the carousel.

## 🔍 Phase 2: The "Selection" (Carousel Engagement)

**The Behavior**: The user swipes through the 6 alpacas (Elvis, Micky, Suri, etc.).
- Each slide feels like a "dating profile" (Age, Character, Ideally For...).
- The user naturally starts picking a favorite (e.g., "Oh, Ricky hums? That's so cute, my partner would love him!").

**Action**: The user clicks the **"Link in Bio"** or the **Story Link Sticker**.

## 🏔️ Phase 3: The "Validation" (Landing Page)

**The Content**: The user lands on `/nl/winter-vol-liefde`.
- **Social Proof**: They see "4.9/5 stars" and "400+ visitors," which builds trust.
- **The Contrast**: They read the "TV vs. Us" table. They laugh at "Fake TV Drama" and feel the pull of "Unconditional Alpaca Love."
- **The Solution**: They see the 3-tier packages (Lite, Popular, VIP). It's easy to understand and priced competitively.

**Action**: The user clicks **"Buy Voucher"**.

## 🎁 Phase 4: The "Surprise" (Voucher flow)

**The Interaction**: 
- The user enters the checkout flow.
- They see the **Valentine's Special Voucher Preview** (the pink/heart design).
- It feels premium and high-end, confirming they are making a "good" gift choice.

**Action**: They enter their email and complete the Stripe payment.

## 🚀 The Result (The After-Effect)
